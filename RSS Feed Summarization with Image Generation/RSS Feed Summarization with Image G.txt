RSS Feed Summarization with Image Generation - n8n Workflow Documentation
Overview
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading RSS feed articles, generating AI-powered summaries with accompanying images, and storing the results in Airtable. The scenario runs on a weekly schedule every Monday at 9 AM, fetching articles from a specific RSS feed, processing them through Google Gemini AI to create summaries and relevant images, then saving the enriched content to an Airtable database. This workflow is particularly designed for content curation and automated blog/news article processing with AI-enhanced visuals.
Connected Applications

RSS Feed (via rss.app)
Google Gemini AI (for chat/summarization and image generation)
Airtable (for data storage)
