n8n Workflow Documentation: AI Success Story (Bharath)
Overview
This n8n workflow automates the creation of professional B2B marketing success story documents. It receives customer data via webhook, uses an AI agent powered by OpenAI to generate a fully formatted HTML success story based on a detailed template, converts the HTML to PDF format using PDF.co's API, downloads the generated PDF file, and finally uploads it to Google Drive. The entire process transforms structured customer information into a polished, branded success story document without manual intervention.

Workflow Nodes
1. Webhook

Webhook ID: 3b5d4a7b-8f59-4018-8efb-a27fab0c973e

It accepts JSON payloads containing customer success story data including fields like Industry, Company Name, Location, Product Focus, Target Market, Key Challenge, Campaign Duration, Initial Investment, Key Results, ROI, Client Quote, Client Name, and Client Title. The webhook serves as the entry point where external systems or users can submit data to initiate the success story generation process.

2. AI Agent

Strict instructions to output only valid HTML code without markdown formatting

Description: This is the core intelligence node that processes the incoming data and generates a complete HTML document. It uses the connected OpenAI Chat Model to transform the structured input data into a professionally formatted success story following the exact template specifications. The AI maintains the required field labels, applies the specified styling, and creates narrative content for each section including client overview, challenges, approach, timeline table, results, and client testimonials.

Description: This node provides the language model capabilities to the AI Agent. It connects to OpenAI's API using the gpt-4o-mini model, which processes the prompt and input data to generate the HTML content. This model handles the natural language generation, content structuring, and ensures the output adheres to the detailed template requirements provided in the AI Agent's prompt.

Html: {{ $json.output }} (the HTML generated by AI Agent)
Name: SucessStory.pdf



Description: This node sends the AI-generated HTML to PDF.co's conversion API. It makes a POST request with the HTML content in the body and receives back a response containing a URL to the generated PDF file. The API key authenticates the request, and the service handles the HTML-to-PDF conversion with proper rendering of all styles, formatting, and content.
